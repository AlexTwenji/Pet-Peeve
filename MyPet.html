    <h1>MY 3 PETS:)</h1>
    <p>I have 3 pets, all of them cats. Each with its own distinct characteristics and individuality.</p>
    <p>Their names are; Monty, Flucky and Wa-John

    <p>Facts about each cat:</p> 
    <ol>
      <li>
        Monty:
        <ul>
          <li>He's loosely named after the cartoon character Morty from Rick and Morty.</li>
          <li>He's the most playful one of the bunch.</li>
          <li>He always knows when I arrive home and always runs towards me.</li>
          <li>He champions for food for both he and Flucky, since they arrived together about 2 months ago.</li>
          <li>He never uses his claws when playing, unless it's with me.</li>
          <li>I think of our playtime as me training him on how to use his claws.</li>
